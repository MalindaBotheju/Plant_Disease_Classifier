# Plant Disease Classifier 🌿

A deep learning project to classify plant leaf diseases using PyTorch and transfer learning.

## Features
- Train a CNN model (ResNet/MobileNet)
- Evaluate with accuracy + confusion matrix
- Predict on new images
- Save best model checkpoint

## How to run (Colab)
1. Open the Colab notebook
2. Run all cells
3. Upload a leaf image to test prediction

## Outputs
The notebook saves:
- `outputs/run_001/best_model.pt`
- `outputs/run_001/metrics.json`
- `outputs/run_001/confusion_matrix.png`
